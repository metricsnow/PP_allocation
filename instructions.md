1. **First**: Add your files
   - Click "Browse..." next to "Stores CSV File" and select your CSV file
   - Click "Browse..." next to "Excel File" and select your Excel file

2. **Check**: Make sure "PRE ALLOCATION" appears in the "Excel Sheet Name" field

3. **Start**: Click the "Process Files" button

4. **Wait**: The program works through your files
   - Watch the progress bar at the bottom
   - The log area shows what's happening
